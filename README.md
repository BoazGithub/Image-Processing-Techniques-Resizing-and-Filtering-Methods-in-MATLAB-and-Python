Image Processing Techniques: Resizing and Filtering Methods in MATLAB and Python"

Introduction
Image processing is a crucial field in computer vision and digital media, encompassing various techniques to enhance, manipulate, and analyze visual information. This assignment focuses on key image processing operations, including resizing and filtering, implemented using both MATLAB and Python programming languages. Resizing involves changing the dimensions of an image, which can be essential for preparing images for further analysis or ensuring compatibility with various display devices. Filtering, on the other hand, is utilized to modify or enhance image characteristics by suppressing noise and improving image quality.

Background
The ability to process images effectively is fundamental in various applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, and machine learning. Resizing techniques such as nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic interpolation are commonly used to manipulate image sizes while maintaining visual fidelity. Each method has distinct advantages and applications, making it essential to understand their differences.

In conjunction with resizing, filtering methods like Gaussian filtering and median filtering play vital roles in image enhancement. Gaussian filters are employed to reduce image noise and detail, while median filters are particularly effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise without significantly blurring edges. Understanding these methods' theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations can significantly enhance one's ability to analyze and interpret image data.

This assignment not only demonstrates the application of these techniques through code examples in MATLAB and Python but also encourages a deeper understanding of how various image processing methods can be employed to achieve desired visual outcomes. By exploring these fundamental operations, students will gain valuable insights into the critical role of image processing in modern technology.
